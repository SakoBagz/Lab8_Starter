Service workers run in the background and can cache data, allowing your app to work offline and load faster. They handle network requests separately from the main app, so the user experience remains smooth. Graceful degradation ensures that if service workers arenâ€™t supported, the app still works by falling back to basic functionality like direct network requests. Together, they make web apps more reliable and user friendly across different browsers and conditions.
